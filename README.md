# Decred Independent Contractor Roadmap

[WRITE ABOUT, 1. Why this roadmap, 2.Explain this is not a full list, 3. People are not bound to what they say here, 4. How community can provide feedback]



### bee:

Continue producing Decred Journal. I hope to delegate more work to free up time for other [ideas](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues).﻿


### degeri:

I started contributing to Decred 2018 and the response from the community has been very positive. My primary goal is strengthening Decred's security. I do this by selecting 2-3 active projects per month and working on them, I will continue this cycle in 2019.

There is joint research and development ["Decred git/contributor analysis"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/34) work that is being done by both me and @s_ben.

The [Bug bounty proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d33a2667469b56942adf42453def6cc2292325251e4cf791e806939ea9efc9e1) that I put up has passed, I expect this will take up the bulk of my time Q1 of 2019 as we work out any hitches in the rules, scope, methodology etc. After that I will start working on a bug bounty website (for submission, triage, work allocation etc) based on Politeia. I will NOT be billing for this work. The plan to get it built up to a POC stage first before I ask the community for funding and extra hands via a Proposal.

I will also continue helping out the community wherever possible both offline and online. :slightly_smiling_face: 

### elian:

My main contribution to Decred in the past 6 months has been organizing meetups for the crypto community in Mexico, connecting with exchanges in Latam and translating basic content for the Spanish speaking audience.

2019 will be a great year to continue expanding Decred outreach in Mexico and Latam. There are already plans for the next 3 meetups in Mexico City for January, February, and March. In April we will have an expo booth in Talent Land 2019, the biggest tech expo in Mexico and Latam where we are expecting to show the project to more than 33k attendees. I have started conversations with 5 exchanges in Latam in order to have DCR listed this year against MXN, ARS, CLP, and COP. I will continue managing the twitter account @Decred_MX (https://twitter.com/decred_mx) and the Medium Decred en Español (https://medium.com/@decred_es), for fundamental readings and information of Decred in Spanish. Following the steps of Decred BR, I am looking forward to expanding DCR presence in all the Spanish speaking countries and grow our community base in Latam.

### Guang: 

I look forward to contribute to expanding DCR presence in Asia with focus around Southeast Asia and China. I see my role in 2019 be mainly around below 

Contents : Making Decred related contents more accessible to the community, include but not limiting to translating, writing, collaborating with Decred supporters, manage social media. 

Events : Meetups/events in the region, attending events/meetups, identifying (potential) Decred supporters, collaboration on events / meetups 

### Michae2xl:

Continue producing Weekly Video for Brazilian Community (Youtube Channel) and Continue help Emilio in brazilians channels. 
Continue supporting newcomers (BR,CA) and slacks invites.
More Meetups in 2019 in Canada-Toronto and if as possible support in Brazil as well.
Building an organic community in Canada, partners, markets and continue helping out the every Decred community (offline, online and in person as well).
(test) I'm thinking in separate features as media's (e.g twitter/decredexplorer) or something like that to find differents ways for people learn about Decred, like a thought structure, so everyone can choose each feature to see first (study the feature like a project and unified later (e.g atomic swap, politeia, spv, dcrdata, decrediton, etc), for the first impact using the docs.decred.org.
Continue manage all media's below and anothers channels as possible to help, improves contents, to use key words (suggetions that I saw in channels), bring more connections like volunteers, devs, holders, so they can help us to growth our community and network (natural process).

My own Decred-related plans for 2019 involve more of the same kind of thing I’ve been doing in 2018, following along and looking for useful ways I can contribute. It’s a dynamic project and I wouldn’t want to guess what that will involve past February or March. I’m not alone in thinking that growing the contributor-base with talented people is one of the main priorities though.

The research program is developing nicely, there are plenty of good ideas and they’re slowly developing — nobody is in a rush.

I will keep doing Politeia Digest for as long as it seems useful, but unless and until the pace of proposals picks up again I will publish it on a more ad hoc timeframe. In other words whenever something interesting happens. There were times when I felt pressure to finish and publish an issue in a certain timeframe (all self-inflicted) while busy with other things, and that made it less enjoyable to work on. It gave me some insight into why the developers on the team prefer not to work towards target dates — total buzz-kill.

The project I am most interested in developing is an information resource/repository about blockchain consensus and governance, making it easier for people to identify, understand, and follow the phenomenon. I have some ideas for how to organize this and what it should look like, but it’s on the back-burner for now and needs some focused attention to figure out what’s likely to work.
